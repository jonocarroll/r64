# `r64` - a c64/6502 assembler in R

Full documentation is available here:
[coolbutuseless.github.io/package/r64](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/r64)

## Rationale

-   Who *doesn’t* want a compiler for a **1 MHz** 8-bit computer with 16
    colours and a max resolution of 320x200?
-   A 6502 assembler in R will allow for preparing/calculating data in R
    and then incorporating directly into the assembly code. e.g. 
    -   creating character sets
    -   computing animation paths

## Features

General features

-   Basic syntax only. Similar to TASS64 syntax.
-   Settable program counter
    -   e.g. `* = $0801`
-   Defined variables
    -   e.g. `border = $d020`
-   Low/High byte extraction from symbol (similar to TASS)
    -   e.g. `lda #<routine` will store the low byte of the address of
        symbol `routine` in the `A` register

For integration with R

-   `.rtext` directive to include an `R` string as text data
-   `.rbyte` directive to include an `R` integer vector as bytes
-   `{...}` to delimit code to be evaluated at run time to manipulate
    labels and variables e.g. `lda {border + 1}`

## Limitations

This is the very definition of a *toy assembler*. There is enough
support for writing simple code, but it is lacking a lot of niceties.

-   For most basic assembly code, the syntax is very similar to TASS64
-   Errors will be thrown for most syntax errors, but there are still
    corner cases that are untested. It might just turn some things into
    code even if it doesn’t make sense. e.g. a `jmp` to a location more
    than 128 bytes away.
-   `indirect indexed` and `indexed indirect` modes using symbolic
    addresses seems to work, but need more tests.
-   No Support for decimal and binary literals. e.g. Currently can’t do
    `lda #127` or `lda #b01111111`
-   All bytes must be in 2-character hexadecimal and preceded by a `$`.
    I.e. `$01` is ok, but `$1` won’t work.
-   All word values by in 4-character hexadecimal and preceded by a `$`.
    I.e. `$0820` is ok, but `$820` won’t work.
-   You may need to force zero page addressing modes with
    symbols/variables by explicitly noting that only the low byte should
    be used. e.g.
    -   `BUFPNT = $A6` is the pointer to the tape i/o buffer
    -   `lda <BUFPNT` should be used to force zero page addressing mode,
        otherwise `lda BUFPNT` would assume absolute addressing mode.
    -   The actual result would be the same, but zero page addressing
        takes fewer bytes and is faster than absolute.

## Installation

`r64` depends on a lot of tidyverse packages as well as the
[flexo](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/flexo) package (for splitting
the c64 asm code into tokens).

``` r
devtools::install_github('coolbutuseless/flexo') # for lexing the 6502 assembly into tokens
devtools::install_github('coolbutuseless/r64')
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the package is available online at
[coolbutuseless.github.io](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/r64)
(thanks to [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown))

## Vignettes

-   `helloworld` - write text to the screen
-   `helloborder` - colour cycling in the border as fast as possible
-   `helloworld_details` - a look at the intermediate assembly outputs
    during compilation
-   `ascii` - Using R-specific `.rbyte` directive to put characters from
    an R variable into the assembly code
-   `custom_character_set` - Building a custom character set in R and
    passing it into the assemblly code with the `.rbyte` directive.
-   `symbol-arithmetic` - How to do arithmetic on the program counter
    and address labels

The code for the vignettes is also available in the `prg/` directory of
this repository.

## Running c64 programs

-   Online emulators (both of which will let you drag-and-drop)
    -   [c64js.com](http://www.c64js.com/)
    -   [virtualconsoles.com](https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/c64/)
-   Native
    -   [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/)

## A simple 6502 program

The following c64/6502 ASM code will clear the screen and then write
`Hello #rstats!` at the top

``` r
asm <- '
*=$0801
  .byte $0c, $08, $0a, $00, $9e, $20  ; 10 SYS 2080
  .byte $32, $30, $38, $30, $00, $00
  .byte $00

*=$0820
      lda #$93        ; Clear the screen
      jsr $ffd2

      ldx #$00        ; initialise the offset pointer into our message
loop  lda message,x   ; load a character and write it to screen 
      and #$3f        ; Manually place chars on screen
      sta $0400,x
      inx
      cpx #$0e
      bne loop

      rts

message
    .text "Hello #rstats!"
'
```

## Compile the program and show the compiled program bytes

``` r
prg_df <- r64::compile(asm)
```

## Compare `r64` output to `TASS64` output

TASS64 is a well known 6502 assembler. Here i will use it to compile the
same code and compare the output. It should be identical. `r64::TASS` is
a an [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6) wrapper around the
command line executable to just make things a bit easier.

``` r
tass <- r64::TASS$new(asm = asm)$compile()
```

    ## Error messages:    None
    ## Warning messages:  None

``` r
identical(r64::extract_prg_bytes(prg_df), tass$get_prg())
```

    ## [1] TRUE

## Run c64 programs using VICE

``` r
prg_filename <- tempfile()
r64::save_prg(prg_df, prg_filename)
system(paste("/usr/local/opt/vice/x64.app/Contents/MacOS/x64", prg_filename), wait=FALSE)
```

## Breakdown of assembly process

The compiler makes a few passes through the data to resolve symbol
values.

The `r64::compile()` function is just a wrapper which calls the
following 4 functions

1.  `line_tokens <- r64::create_line_tokens(asm)`
    -   For each line in the input break it into tokens.
    -   Filter any rows that contain no instructions
2.  `prg_df <- r64::create_prg_df(line_tokens)`
    -   Create a data.frame from `line_tokens`
    -   This is the key data structure for the compilation process
    -   The compilation process is just a matter of manipulating this
        data.frame and merging with information about the instructions
3.  `prg_df <- r64::process_symbols(prg_df)`
    -   Resolve labels to their actual addresses
    -   Replace any defined variables with their values
4.  `prg_df <- r64::process_zero_padding(prg_df)`
    -   If there are gaps between blocks of code, insert zero bytes

An example of the final form of the `prg_df` data.frame is show below.
The actual contents of the c64 `prg` file is just the sequence of values
in the `hexbytes` column.

``` r
prg_df %>%
  select(addr, label, line, opcommand, op, ophex, nbytes, hexbytes) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| addr | label   | line                          | opcommand     | op  | ophex | nbytes | hexbytes                                               |
